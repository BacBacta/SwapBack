## üî• Deflationary Mechanism

### Buyback & Burn

SwapBack implements a **continuous deflationary mechanism** through automated buyback and burn:

1. **Revenue Collection:**
   - **30% of routing fees** ‚Üí Buyback allocation
   - **20% of NPI (routing profit)** ‚Üí Buyback allocation

2. **Automatic Buyback:**
   - USDC accumulated ‚Üí Swapped to $BACK via Jupiter
   - Triggered when buyback vault reaches threshold (100 USDC minimum)

3. **Permanent Burn:**
   - **100% of bought $BACK** is permanently burned
   - Reduces circulating supply over time
   - Creates upward price pressure

### Burn Rate Projection

Based on projected volume:

| Daily Volume | Daily Surplus | Daily Buyback USDC | Annual Burn % |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| $10,000 | $250 | $62.50 | ~2.3% |
| $100,000 | $2,500 | $625 | ~23% |
| $1,000,000 | $25,000 | $6,250 | ~230%* |

*Note: High volume scenarios may result in significant deflation over time.

## üöÄ Utility

### 1. Trading Rebates (Primary Use Case)

- **Base Rebates:** 60% of routing profit returned to users
- **Boosted Rebates:** Up to +20% bonus with $BACK locked

**Example:**
- Swap generates 50 USDC routing profit
- Base rebate: 30 USDC (60%)
- With 1M $BACK locked for 180 days ‚Üí **+8.65 USDC bonus** (17.3% boost)
- **Total rebate: 38.65 USDC**

### 2. Boost System (Lock & Earn)

Lock $BACK to earn boosted rebates on every swap:

**Dynamic Boost Formula:**
```
amount_score = min((tokens / 10,000) √ó 100, 1000 BP)  // Max 10%
duration_score = min((days / 5) √ó 10, 1000 BP)        // Max 10%
total_boost = min(amount_score + duration_score, 2000 BP)  // Max 20%
```

**Boost Tiers (Examples):**

| Tokens Locked | Duration | Boost % | Example Rebate Increase |
|--------------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| 50,000 | 30 days | 1.1% | $50 ‚Üí $50.55 |
| 500,000 | 90 days | 6.8% | $50 ‚Üí $53.40 |
| 2,000,000 | 180 days | 17.3% | $50 ‚Üí $58.65 |
| 10,000,000 | 365 days | 20% (max) | $50 ‚Üí $60 |

### 3. Governance (Future)

- Vote on protocol parameters
- Propose new features
- Allocate treasury funds

### 4. Protocol Benefits

- Reduced trading fees (planned)
- Priority routing (planned)
- Exclusive features access

## üíé Value Accrual

$BACK captures value through multiple mechanisms:

### 1. **Continuous Buyback Pressure**
- 20-30% of all protocol revenue buys $BACK
- Creates consistent buy pressure regardless of market conditions
- Automated and transparent on-chain

### 2. **Supply Reduction**
- 100% of bought tokens permanently burned
- Circulating supply decreases over time
- Remaining tokens become more scarce

### 3. **Utility Demand**
- Users need $BACK to access boosted rebates
- Higher volume = more incentive to lock $BACK
- Creates natural demand from power users

### 4. **Protocol Growth**
- As SwapBack grows, more revenue ‚Üí more buybacks
- Network effects: better routes ‚Üí more users ‚Üí higher revenue
- Positive feedback loop
