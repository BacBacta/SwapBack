📊 CURRENT STATE

✅ Pre-compiled binaries exist:
   • libswapback_router.so  (640 KB)
   • libswapback_cnft.so    (600 KB)
   • libswapback_buyback.so (644 KB)

✅ Frontend MVP: COMPLETE (345 MB optimized)

✅ Tests ready: 237/239 passing

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 PHASE 2 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

Given the environment constraints, here are your best options:

OPTION 1: Use Pre-Compiled Binaries + Web3.js (Recommended) ⭐⭐⭐
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is the FASTEST & MOST RELIABLE approach:

  ✅ No CLI installation issues
  ✅ Uses @solana/web3.js directly
  ✅ Works in any JavaScript environment
  ✅ Full programmatic control
  ✅ Same end result as CLI

Implementation:
  1. Create TypeScript deployment script (ready)
  2. Load pre-compiled binaries
  3. Connect to devnet
  4. Deploy contracts programmatically
  5. Extract program IDs
  6. Update SDK

Time: 15-20 minutes

File: phase2-deploy.ts (already created)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION 2: Use Docker (If Installed) ⭐⭐
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If Docker becomes available:

  docker run --rm -v \$(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace \\
    solanalabs/solana:v1.18.22 \\
    solana deploy target/release/libswapback_router.so --url devnet

  ✅ Guaranteed to work
  ✅ Pre-configured environment
  ❌ Requires Docker

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION 3: Manual Devnet Testing (Fast) ⭐
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For testing purposes, you can:

  1. Use existing public devnet program IDs
  2. Connect frontend to published contracts
  3. Test MVP functionality with real on-chain interactions
  
  ✅ Immediate testing
  ✅ No deployment needed
  ❌ Not your own deployed contracts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 (TypeScript/web3.js)

This is the smartest choice because:

  ✅ No CLI installation issues
  ✅ Leverages what we already have (@solana/web3.js in SDK)
  ✅ Full control and visibility
  ✅ Same end result as CLI
  ✅ Can retry programmatically
  ✅ Better error handling
  ✅ Works in any environment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📚 ALTERNATIVE APPROACH - SIMPLER FOR NOW

Since we're experiencing CLI installation challenges, let's take a PRAGMATIC approach:

IMMEDIATE GOAL:
  1. Deploy frontend MVP to Vercel (with demo mode)
  2. Document Phase 2 deployment steps
  3. Provide clear instructions for when Solana CLI is ready
  4. Create SDK with configuration for future use

ADVANTAGE:
  ✅ MVP launches TODAY with working frontend
  ✅ Users can test swap UI/UX
  ✅ Phase 2 contracts added later transparently
  ✅ No user impact when contracts go live

This is actually BETTER than waiting because:

  1. You get feedback on UI first
  2. Contracts integrate seamlessly later
  3. No delay to market
  4. Learn from users what they want

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR DECISION POINT

Choose ONE:

  A) DEPLOY FRONTEND NOW + Plan Phase 2
     • MVP launches to Vercel in 5 minutes
     • Users test UI/UX immediately
     • Add contracts next week after feedback
     • RECOMMENDED - gets value to market fastest

  B) CONTINUE WITH PHASE 2 PROGRAMMATIC DEPLOYMENT
     • Use TypeScript/web3.js approach
     • Deploy contracts programmatically
     • Everything ready for production
     • Takes 15-20 more minutes

  C) WAIT FOR SOLANA CLI
     • Let Solana CLI finish installing
     • Use traditional CLI-based deployment
     • Takes unknown time (installation in progress)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ QUICK SUMMARY

  Option A (Recommended):  Launch MVP now (5 min), add contracts later (1 week)
  Option B:               Complete MVP now (20 min), ship everything together
  Option C:               Wait for CLI installation (unknown time)

Which would you prefer?

  Say: \"A\" (launch frontend now)
  Say: \"B\" (complete Phase 2 first)
  Say: \"C\" (wait for CLI)
